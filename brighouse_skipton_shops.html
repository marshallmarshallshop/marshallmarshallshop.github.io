              <p>Our original shop opened in June 2006, and we’ve been giving our customers a friendly welcome ever since.  Decorated as beautifully as if it was our own home, this shop is a little breath of fresh air. You’ll never feel pushed to buy anything, but the fact is, you’ll be so bowled over with choice that you won’t know what to choose – that’s where our team will help you with honest opinions to make that all important decision.</p>
       		  <p class="testi">&quot;Was told to come to Marshall &amp; Marshall! Wow! How fantastic! I was not disappointed! Brilliant - should be more shops like this!<br />
              Well done!&quot;<br />

              <p>Depending on what you’re looking for, you’ll be drawn to the eye-popping display of jewellery in the centre of the room, but make sure you don’t miss anything on the shelves and dressers. You may need to walk around a few times to see everything!</p>
