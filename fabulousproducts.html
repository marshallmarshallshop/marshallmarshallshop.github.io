              <p class="top">We don’t buy things in bulk and we don’t buy once or twice a year. We’re constantly on the lookout for just the right pieces that our lovely customers are searching for.</p>
                <p>Sometimes that means we’ll only have individual pieces of jewellery, and when we find a stunning top or even a prom dress, we usually only buy one of each size to maintain that important exclusive look that’s just yours.</p>
                <p>Here‘s a taster of some of our lovely, and sometimes unusual, products to give you an idea of what you’ll find when you visit our <a href="brighouse_skipton_shops.html">shops</a>:</p>
       		    <p class="testi">&quot;Really like this shop, always count on it for lovely gifts. Lots of variety and unique products. Staff are always helpful and friendly. Recommend you visit&quot;<br />
                    <span>Chantel, Brighouse</span></p>
   		      <h1 class="clothing"><span>Clothing</span></h1>
                <p>We choose the pieces in our clothing range because they make us feel beautiful every time we wear them. They are designed to lift an otherwise ordinary outfit, and show the world that that we care about how we look.  If you’re buying something for yourself, you can try it on in our elegant fitting rooms, and our team in the shop will be happy to find a different size or colour, or give you tips on how it will look best on you. Our scarves and handbags will add extra sparkle.</p>

              <h1 class="jewellery"><span>Jewellery</span></h1>
                <p>Our customers regularly tell us how people comment on their choice of jewellery, how well it looks with their outfit or how they always seem to choose the right accessories. The truth is, our jewellery range is so classically beautiful that they complement almost any outfit – you’ll be delighted at how effortless it is to look fabulous every day! </p>
       		    <p class="testi">&quot;Love your interesting jewellery. Would like to be able to buy from Northumberland&quot;<br />
                    <span>John, Northumberland</span></p>
   		      <h1 class="ind"><span>Individual and fashion aware</span></h1>
                <p>Our full range includes hand-picked pieces that we love from a selection of different companies. In amongst them, you’ll find that some of our favourite pieces are from Hultquist and Danon.</p>
                <p>For many years, we’ve stocked Hultquist jewellery, because, like us, it expresses individualism and fashion awareness.  Inspired by a mixture of different cultures from past and present, this gorgeous Scandinavian range is feminine and bohemian. All plated with silver or gold, the stones are selected Swarovski crystal, quartz, fresh-water pearls or Czech glass beads.</p>
                <p>We’re in love with it at Marshall and Marshall, and so are you it seems!</p>
