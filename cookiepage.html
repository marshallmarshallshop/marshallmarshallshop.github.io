  <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
  <p><strong>This website, like most websites, works best for you when allowed to use cookies. 
Here is information about cookies on this site and how you can control them.</strong></p>
  <p>Cookies are small text files which are stored by the browser (eg Internet Explorer) on your
    computer or mobile when you first visit this site or a particular page. The cookie will help this
    site to recognise your device the next time you visit. While cookies of various types can be
    embedded into sites, unless stated otherwise, the cookies used on this site are restricted to
    two types, analytical and session cookies.</p>
  <h3>Analytical cookies</h3>
  <p>These cookies are used for statistical analysis only and the information generated is
    completely anonymous – they cannot be used to identify individuals. Every time someone
    visits this site, analytics software provided by a third party generates an anonymous
    analytics cookie. The purpose is to tell us whether or not you have visited this site before.</p>
  <p>Your browser tells us if you already have these cookies, and if you don't, we generate new
    ones. From this, we can track how many individual unique users we have and how often
    they visit this site. From this, where relevant, we can improve the navigation on the site.</p>
  <h3>Session cookies</h3>
  <p><strong>Session cookies are designed to improve your journey, or ‘session’, through this
    site. They allow a web page to remember that you have visited it and to retain any
    relevant information you may have input on a particular page. This ensures that
    you are not asked for the same information you have already provided.</strong></p>
  <h3>How can I turn cookies off?</h3>
  <p>This is something you control in your browser settings, either as a general instruction for all
    websites or selectively for individual websites you visit. Usually your browser settings are
    in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser. Here are links to information about
    cookie settings relating to the most commonly used browsers:</p>
